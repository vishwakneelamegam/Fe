Fe(Function-executor)
Extract function from the string and execute it.
For example if the user says "Turn on the light",
the program extracts the function and arguments from the string ["Turn on the light" => on("light")] and executes it.  I have initially released in python and javascript.  You have to define your function that has to be executed in json format.  Look the code.
